# Projects

1. Aro 309 Asteriod Impactor Mission (had to split up the powerpoint presentation due to size limitation) 
* Was the programer, code can be seen in part 2, slides: 5 and 6.
* Selecting mission date, part 2, slides 8 to 14. 

2.  Classical_Liminate_Theory_Hw_Project
* Small bi-weekly project
* Used MATLAB to find the running stiffness (ABBD) matrix of the laminate, stress and strains and margin of satefty for individual plys.

3. Senior Design: Computational and Experimental Investigation of the Aerodynamics of a Forward-Swept Wing Compared to the Same Wing with  Aft Sweep and No Sweep Final Report
* Contribution: Section 3.1, First Order Aero Analysis, pg. 25 to 33.
* Section 5.2 - 6.1, Static Load Testing, pg. 57 to 59. 

4. AIAA Competition Project: Hermes Aeronautics Envoy 600 Final Design Report
* Contribution: Section 5, Aerodynamics, pg. 32 to 40.

5. NASTRAN Thermal Analysis 
* Applying a nonlinear gap to a structure with an applied thermal load in NX NASTRAN, comparing the output to hand results. 

6. Simulation_of_a_Fuselage_Floor_under_Loading_Report
* FEAMAP Project
